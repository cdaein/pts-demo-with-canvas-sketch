# pts.js demo recreated with canvas-sketch

I'm learning how to use `pts.js` with its [official demo sketches](https://ptsjs.org/demo/?name=pts.quickStart). This repo is to recreate them with `canvas-sketch` and its supplied Canvas/context.

As the canvas object is provided by `canvas-sketch`, I do not use `CanvasSpace` object from `pts` library.
