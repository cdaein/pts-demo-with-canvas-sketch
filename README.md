# pts.js demo sketches with canvas-sketch

I'm learning how to use `pts.js` with its [official demo sketches](https://ptsjs.org/demo/?name=pts.quickStart). This repo is to recreate them with `canvas-sketch` and its supplied Canvas/context.

As I am using the existing canvas, there is no `CanvasSpace`, only `CanvasForm` is used.

## Why
I like `canvas-sketch` for its many helpful tools such as image/video export and git-based sketch snapshots. `pts.js` seems like it can be a good companion with its highly modular structure and a very light weight.
