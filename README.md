# pts.js demo sketches with canvas-sketch

This repo recreates `pts.js` [official demo sketches](https://ptsjs.org/demo/?name=pts.quickStart) with `canvas-sketch` and its supplied Canvas/context. As I am using the existing canvas, there is no `CanvasSpace`, only `CanvasForm` is used. I added a few new variables that replace `CanvasSpace` properties such as `space.pointer`, `space.innerBound` and etc.

## Why
I like `canvas-sketch` for its many helpful tools such as image/video export and git-based sketch snapshots. `pts.js` seems like it can be a good companion with its highly modular structure and a very light weight.
